## CONCLUSION ##
We have to make the prop function inside the parent component.
## STEPS ##
1) define the function we want to use as prop. In this case, I made a function called handleDelete to delete a blog.
2) Enter the parameter (id, in this case).
3) blogs.filter(blog => blog.id !== id) is just a method to filter the blogs based on what job we wanted to tell our code.
In this case, the condition will remain to be true if the blog.id doesn't match the id. If it's true, then we want to keep the blog in the array.
If it's false, if the blog.id DOES match the id clicked, so the blog clicked will be deleted.
4) setBlogs(newBlogs) is just our way to say "look! now the new array of the setBlogs after i deleted some blog(s) are just newBlogs!
