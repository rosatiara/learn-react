useEffect hook runs EVERY RENDERING process.
What if we want to use useEffect only on a particular condition?
We can create second parameter!

Take a look the codes below for example,

useEffect(()=>{
    console.log("hi")
    console.log(name)
  }, [name])

the second parameter of that hook is [name], that means the useEffect hook will runs every time [name] is being renderred.
