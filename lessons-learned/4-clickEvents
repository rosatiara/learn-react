### FILE CHANGED : Home.js ###
const Home = () => {
  const handleClick = () => {
    console.log("hello there!")
  }

  const handleClickAgain = (name) => {
    console.log("well, you again," + name);
  }

  return (
    <div className="home">
      <h2>Homepage</h2>
      <button onClick={handleClick}>Click me</button>
      <button onClick={()=>{handleClickAgain("rosa")}}>Click me again plz</button>
    </div>
   );
}
 
export default Home;
###### CONCLUSION ######
In this example, I learned how to produce some events whenever we click a particular element in our project.
How do we do that? We just simply have to add the onClick={} event listener and pass in any variables you've made.
If we want to pass an argument inside the onClick event, we'll have to wrap the event listener with an anonymous function.
For example, in line 15:
onClick={
  () => {
    handleClickAgain("rosa")
  }
}
