JSON server is super useful to fetch data. In this lesson, I created a folder called data and created a new file called db.json which contains informations about my blogs (array).
to install JSON server locally on your project, just open your terminal and type -> npx json-server --watch <your json file location> --port <port specification>
Note that the port specification is optional.
