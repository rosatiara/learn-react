### FILENAME: Home.js ####

import {useState} from 'react';

const Home = () => {
  // let name = 'mario';
  const [name, setName] = useState("mario")
  const [age, setAge] = useState(20)
  const handleClick = () => {
    setName("ronaldo")
    setAge(40)
  }


  return (
    <div className="home">
      <h2>Homepage</h2>
      <p>{name} is {age} years old</p>
      <button onClick={handleClick}>Click me</button>
    </div>
   );
}
 
export default Home;

## CONCLUSION ##
In this exercise, I learned about useState hook. 
To use it, we have to:
1) import the useState hook from the React library.
2) First thing I wanted to do is to change the {name} everytime I click the button. To take the advantage of useState hook,
we have to make a const array [variable name, function name] and in this case, it is [name, setName] and [age, setAge].
3) the function we made inside the array will be declared on the handleClick onClick event.

Why do we need to use useState hook? To make our variables reactive!
